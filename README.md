Display Chekin (Current Location ) made on Foure Square by specific user

Hardware Required 

1) Arudino Uno
2) LCD Display
3) Lan Sheild
4) Raspberry PI (Optional)
5) TV Remote


Purpose: My parents call me 4-5 times a day just to know where I am or what I am doing. Most of the time I am unable to answer that(due various obivous reasons :p). I find foursquare best solution for this problem, but as my parents do not use smart phone they are unable to see my location.Therefore I came up with this idea that I can dispaly my location using LCD display and arudino along which I can provide an easy to use interface using a TV remote. This display will always be hanging out in my home an any one present @my home can check my location.
Potential Flaw in this idea is it will be difficult to lie about your location to your parents :@
